# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

##Setting up MongoDB

1. Install MongoDB and create a new Connection and connect to it. Find the port and put it in db.js
2. Create a Dreamdiary database and then a new collection within it. Make sure that you get the spelling correct.
3. There is a database test script that will create a database item and remove it. Run that to make sure everything is setup correctly.

## Running the Project

To run it locally, use

npm start

in the console
